# logistic_regression
Project: Implementation of logistric regression for binary classification using gradient descent

Description: Given a 400x3 dimensions data of X and binary values of Y. Task is to generate boundary to separate data using gradient descent.

Requirenment: MATLAB

How to Run and Explanation: Run regreesion_main.m file in matlab. It takes data from dataset4.m file. The project is tested with step size of 1.4 and tolerance value of 0.00000001 and the script runs for 10000000 iteration. The graph is plotted with X1 data in x axis and X2 data in y axis. In another figure it shows, empirical error vs iteration graph.
